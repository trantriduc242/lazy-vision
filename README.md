# lazy-vision
LazyVision is a smart, Raspberry Pi–powered phone mount that tracks your eyes, moves automatically, and supports wireless charging and touchless gesture control. Built with Python, OpenCV, MediaPipe, and Flask, it’s designed for hands-free phone use — whether you’re lying in bed, working, or relaxing.
